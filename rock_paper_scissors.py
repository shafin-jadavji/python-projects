'''
Write a program to simulate a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.  
The game will prompt the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors by typing 'r', 'p', or 's'. 
The computer will randomly select its choice. The game will then display both choices 
using emojis and determine the winner based on the rules.
